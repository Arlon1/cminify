C Minifier
==========

A basic, portable C/C++ minifier I initially wrote to minify shaders.

This basically trims whitespace and removes comments. It doesn't do any lexical analyzing, so complex cases may make it fail.

But it got the job done quite a few times for me.

Requirements
============

- Python 2.7.6 and higher


Use
===

- `python minifier.py source.c`
